        <h2>-Service-</h2>
        <p class="about">I am passionate about giving back to the community. I have volunteered for several different
            organizations<br> and worked with incredible people to give back to the Brayn/College Station community
            along
            with other<br> places as well.</p>

        <h3> <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">Big Event</a> </h3>
        <img src="event.jpg" alt="" class="images1">
        <p class="about"> Founded in 1982, The Big Event has become the largest, one-day student-run service project in
            the nation. During <br> the spring, over ten thousand A&M students gather to support the residents of Bryan
            and
            College Station. These past two <br>years, I have participated in this event with my organization to give
            back
            to a family in Bryan. Last year, my team helped a family <br>landscape by relocating an enormous pile
            of
            mulch through a garden. We assigned positions to make the process more efficient.<br> The positions we had
            were
            breaking up the mulch, filling up the wagons, and transporting the wagons.</p>

        <img src="habitat.png" alt="" class="images1">
        <p class="about"> My first two years in university, I was in <a href="https://www.tamufest.org/">F.E.S.T.</a>
            which is a leadership/service
            organization. In this org, we worked a lot with different non-profits to give back to the community. One
            organization we
            worked a lot with was called Habitat for Humanity. Founded in 1976, Habitat for Humanity is a non-profit
            Christian organization that helps families build and improve homes for the less fortunate. We worked with
            them to paint walls, move materials, design buildings, landscape, and more. One event that they hold on
            campus is called Shack-A-Thon which is a means of raising awareness of poverty housing to the students of
            A&M. In this event, organizations design "shacks" for members to stay in for a week. At least one person
            has to be in the shack for the entire duration of the week.

        <h3><a href="https://www.bvfb.org/">Brazos Valley Food Bank</a> </h3>
        <img src="brazos.png" alt="" class="images1">
        <p class="about"> Another organization we worked with in my time with F.E.S.T. was the Brazon Valley Food Bank.
            Founded in 1985, the Brazos Valley Food Bank strives to feed tens of thousands of individuals in need.
            Through partner agencies, BFVB aims to solve hunger by utilizing it thousands of volunteers to distribute
            nutritious food.
